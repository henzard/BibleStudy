## Purpose

Generate a weekly newsletter that:
- Captures attention in a noisy world (Bang! principle)
- Creates anticipation for next week (Hooked model)
- Remains Bible-focused and avoids sensationalism
- Is shareable but not manipulative

---

## Core Principles from "Hooked" and "Bang!"

### From Hooked (Nir Eyal):
1. **Trigger:** Weekly consistency (every Friday/Monday) creates external trigger
2. **Action:** Make it easy to consume (scannable, visual, quick read)
3. **Variable Reward:** Different findings each week keep it fresh
4. **Investment:** End with prayer/action points (increases future engagement)

### From Bang! (Kaplan Thaler):
1. **Cut through noise:** Strong headline, clear message
2. **Memorable hook:** Lead with most compelling finding
3. **Emotional connection:** Scripture focus, not just data
4. **Simplicity:** Bullet points, emojis, clear sections

---

## Newsletter Structure (Required Format)

### 1. Headline (attention-grabbing but honest)
- **Format:** "Weekly Watch [Date]: [Compelling Finding or Theme]"
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ "Weekly Watch Dec 26: 6,279 Landmine Casualties, but Peace Still Possible"
  - ✅ "Weekly Watch Dec 26: 74 Earthquakes This Week — Matt 24:8 Observed"
  - ❌ "BREAKING: The End is Near!" (too sensational, violates Matt 24:36)
  - ❌ "Nothing Happened This Week" (boring, defeats purpose)

### 2. Quick Summary (TL;DR - 2-3 sentences)
- What happened this week in 50 words or less
- Include confidence level (High/Med/Low)
- Cite Scripture reference

### 3. This Week's Highlights (bullet format with emojis)
- 🌍 **Earthquakes/Disasters** (J0)
- ⚔️ **Wars/Conflicts** (J0)
- 📉 **Economic Indicators** (H0)
- ✝️ **Persecution** (J1) [if relevant]
- **Use confidence icons:** 🟢 Low, 🟠 Med, 🔴 High

### 4. Scripture Focus of the Week
- Pick ONE verse that relates to findings
- Brief (2-3 sentence) reflection
- No speculation, just Scripture

### 5. "What Changed?" Tracker
- Visual comparison to last week
- What increased/decreased
- Trend indicators (📈📉➡️)

### 6. Assessment (Current Phase)
- Where we are in the flowchart (J0, J1, J3, etc.)
- What has NOT happened yet (crucial for honesty)
- "The end is not yet" reminder (Matt 24:6)

### 7. This Week's Action (Investment)
- **Pray:** Specific prayer focus
- **Study:** Suggested Scripture passage
- **Watch:** What to monitor next week
- **Share:** (Optional) Shareable quote/verse

### 8. Closing Reminder (Always Include)
- Matt 24:36 quote
- "This is for observation, not prediction"
- Link to full weekly review

## Ethical Guardrails (MUST FOLLOW)

### ❌ FORBIDDEN:
1. **No date-setting** (violates Matt 24:36)
2. **No fear-mongering** ("Be afraid!" messaging)
3. **No clickbait** (misleading headlines)
4. **No speculation** (stick to observed facts)
5. **No "insider knowledge"** claims
6. **No pressure tactics** ("Share or else!")

### ✅ REQUIRED:
1. **Cite sources** (Tier 1 preferred)
2. **Show confidence levels** (Low/Med/High)
3. **Acknowledge uncertainty** ("I don't know" is acceptable)
4. **Include Matt 24:36** reminder
5. **Emphasize observation over prediction**
6. **Maintain Bible-only posture**

---

## Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy:
1. **Emojis for scannability** (🌍⚔️📉✝️🔴🟠🟢)
2. **Bold for key findings**
3. **Short paragraphs** (max 3 sentences)
4. **Bullet lists** over long prose
5. **Tables** for data comparison

### Tone:
- **Serious but not alarmist**
- **Informative but not boring**
- **Engaging but not manipulative**
- **Hopeful but realistic**
- **Biblical but not preachy**

### Length:
- **Target:** 500-800 words
- **Read time:** 3-5 minutes
- **Scannable** in 30 seconds

---

## Variable Reward Strategy

Keep readers coming back by varying:
1. **Content type:** Sometimes earthquakes lead, sometimes economics
2. **Depth:** Some weeks deep-dive one topic, others survey all
3. **Format:** Sometimes tables, sometimes narrative
4. **Surprise findings:** Highlight unexpected patterns
5. **Scripture connections:** Different passages each week

---

## Call-to-Action (Investment)

End each newsletter with action that increases investment:
- **This Week's Prayer Focus:** Specific, related to findings
- **Scripture Study Challenge:** Read a passage, compare with findings
- **Next Week's Watch List:** What to look for
- **Shareable Insight:** Bible verse + context (not sensational)

This creates anticipation for next week's newsletter.

## Quality Check Questions

Before publishing, ask:
1. Would this newsletter honor God if non-believers read it?
2. Is every claim verifiable with Tier 1 sources?
3. Does it create anticipation without manipulation?
4. Would Jesus approve of the tone and content?
5. Does it help readers understand Scripture better?

If any answer is "no," revise before publishing.
