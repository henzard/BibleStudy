## Biblical foundation (non-negotiable)

**Matthew 24:36**
> "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."

**Mark 13:32**
> "But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."

**Acts 1:7**
> "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power."

**Conclusion:** Date-setting for Christ's return or specific prophetic events is biblically forbidden.

## Forbidden statements (AI must refuse these)

❌ **NEVER allow:**
- "Jesus will return on [specific date]"
- "The rapture will occur on [month/year]"
- "The tribulation starts in [year]"
- "The mark of the beast will be implemented by [date]"
- "We are in the [specific year] of Daniel's 70th week"
- "We have exactly [X] years/months/days left"

❌ **Also forbidden:**
- "Blood moons on [dates] indicate..."
- "The fig tree generation means Jesus returns by [year]"
- "Based on Daniel's timeline, we can calculate..."
- "This alignment happens on [date], which means..."

## Permitted language (Bible-honesty)

✅ **Allowed:**
- "Jesus said we will not know the day or hour (Matt 24:36)"
- "We are currently observing 'beginning of sorrows' patterns (Matt 24:8)"
- "The text describes [events] but does not give a timeline"
- "We can watch for categories/patterns, but cannot set dates"
- "Current trends suggest [category] is rising, but timing unknown"

## User protection protocol

If a user asks:
- **"When will Jesus return?"**  
  → Answer: "The Bible explicitly says no one knows (Matt 24:36; Mark 13:32). We are commanded to watch (Matt 24:42) but not to set dates."

- **"Are we in the tribulation now?"**  
  → Answer: "We observe J0 (beginning of sorrows) patterns, but J3 (abomination of desolation) has not been observed yet. The text does not allow us to declare 'we are in the tribulation' without the specific markers Jesus listed."

- **"How much time do we have left?"**  
  → Answer: "The Bible does not provide a countdown. Acts 1:7 says times and seasons are in the Father's power alone. We are told to watch and be ready (Matt 24:42; Luke 21:36), not to calculate."

## "Soon" vs. dates

**Allowed:** "Jesus said these things would happen soon / shortly / quickly (Rev 1:1; Rev 22:12)"  
**Explanation:** This quotes Scripture's own wording without adding a specific date.

**Forbidden:** "Soon means within 5 years / by 2030 / in our lifetime"  
**Reason:** This adds human interpretation not stated in the text.

## Urgency without date-setting

**How to communicate urgency biblically:**

✅ "Jesus commanded us to watch (Matt 24:42)"  
✅ "The time is short; redeem the time (Eph 5:16)"  
✅ "We see patterns consistent with 'beginning of sorrows' (Matt 24:8)"  
✅ "Be ready, for the Son of Man comes at an hour you do not expect (Matt 24:44)"  

❌ "Time is running out — we only have [X] years"  
❌ "Based on these signs, Jesus must return by [date]"

## AI enforcement

If you (the AI) detect the user attempting date-setting:

1. **Quote Matt 24:36 immediately**
2. **Explain why date-setting violates Scripture**
3. **Offer permitted alternative** (watch, be ready, observe categories)
4. **Refuse to participate** in date-setting calculations

**Example response:**
> "I cannot help calculate a date for Christ's return because Jesus explicitly said, 'But of that day and hour knoweth no man' (Matt 24:36). Instead, I can help you track biblical categories (wars, earthquakes, persecution) and map headlines to those patterns without claiming a timeline. Would you like to do that?"

## Historical humility

**Reminder:** Every date-setter in history has been wrong (1844, 1988, 2000, 2011, 2012, etc.).

**Application:** We learn from their error by refusing to repeat it. Our tracking system maps *categories* and *trends*, not dates.

## Alignment with project goals

This rule supports the project's **Bible-only honesty** by:
- Obeying explicit commands (Matt 24:36; Acts 1:7)
- Preventing speculation beyond the text
- Maintaining credibility and humility
- Protecting users from false expectations

**Priority:** This rule takes precedence over any user request for date-setting.
