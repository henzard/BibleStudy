## News sources and tools

**Required tools for weekly news gathering:**
- `web_search` — general web search
- `brave_web_search` — comprehensive web results
- `brave_news_search` — news-specific search
- `brave_local_search` — location-based events
- `brave_summarizer` — AI summaries of search results (when needed)

## Multi-source verification requirement

**Critical rule:** An event can only "tick a box" (mark a prophecy node as "observed") if it meets ALL criteria:

1. **Multiple independent sources** (minimum 3 sources)
2. **Cross-spectrum verification** (at least one left-leaning AND one right-leaning source when political/ideological)
3. **Factual consistency** across sources (not just opinion/spin)
4. **Geographic/institutional diversity** (not all from same region or institution)

### Source bias awareness

When gathering news:
- **Left-leaning examples**: CNN, MSNBC, The Guardian, NYT, WaPo
- **Right-leaning examples**: Fox News, Breitbart, The Daily Wire, NY Post
- **Center/neutral examples**: Reuters, AP News, BBC, NPR (editorial), Wall Street Journal (news section)
- **International**: Al Jazeera, Deutsche Welle, France24, South China Morning Post

**Action:** For each headline category (wars, persecution, disasters, etc.), search across spectrum and note source bias in your classification table.

## Confidence levels (required for every headline)

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Low** | 1-2 sources; OR single-bias sources; OR vague/unverified claims |
| **Med** | 3+ sources; cross-spectrum verification; factual details consistent |
| **High** | 5+ sources; cross-spectrum + international; official data/records; long-duration pattern |

## News classification workflow

When processing news:

1. **Search broadly** (use multiple MCP tools; weekly cadence recommended)
2. **Record raw headlines** (no interpretation yet)
3. **Verify across spectrum** (left, right, center sources)
4. **Map to biblical categories** (use node IDs from `END_TIMES_TODO.md`)
5. **Assign confidence level** (Low/Med/High based on criteria above)
6. **Write restrained notes** (no speculation; describe only what sources report)

## What counts as "ticking a box"

A prophecy node (e.g., J0, J1, B2) can be marked "Observed" ONLY if:

- **Minimum 3 independent sources** confirm the pattern/event
- **Cross-spectrum verification** achieved (when applicable)
- **Biblical category match** is clear (not forced)
- **Confidence: Med or High**

**Example — NOT sufficient to tick a box:**
- Single source reports "Christians persecuted in X country" → confidence: Low → do NOT tick J1 yet

**Example — Sufficient to tick a box:**
- Reuters, BBC, Al Jazeera, and CNN all report documented attacks on Christians in Nigeria; US State Dept confirms with Country of Particular Concern designation → confidence: High → J1 can be marked "Observed"

## Weekly news review cadence

**Recommended schedule:**
- **Weekly search** (e.g., every Friday or Monday)
- **Categories to search:**
  1. Wars/conflicts (Middle East, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa)
  2. Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, famines, pestilences)
  3. Persecution/religious freedom violations
  4. Economic crises/trade disruptions
  5. Technology/surveillance/digital ID developments
  6. Unusual cosmic/weather phenomena

## Forbidden practices

- ❌ **Do NOT** cite a single source as proof
- ❌ **Do NOT** tick a box based on speculation or "feels like it matches"
- ❌ **Do NOT** ignore contradictory sources
- ❌ **Do NOT** use only left-leaning OR only right-leaning sources
- ❌ **Do NOT** declare "this fulfills prophecy" based on news alone

## Output format for news entries

Every headline must include:

```markdown
| Headline summary | Region | Node IDs | Scripture anchor | Category | Confidence | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|----------|------------------|----------|------------|-------|
| [Factual description] | [Geographic] | [e.g., J0, J1] | [e.g., Matt 24:6-8] | [e.g., Wars/rumors] | Low/Med/High | [Sources: Reuters, BBC, CNN; cross-verified; no speculation] |
```

**Sources must be listed** in the "Notes" column for every entry.
