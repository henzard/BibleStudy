## Core principle: Not all sources are equal

**Biblical parallel:** "Prove all things; hold fast that which is good" (1 Thess 5:21)

**Application:** Even when using multiple sources, we must assess credibility before accepting claims as fact.

## Source credibility tiers

### ✅ Tier 1: High credibility (primary sources preferred)

**News agencies:**
- Reuters, Associated Press (AP), Agence France-Presse (AFP)
- BBC News (news section), PBS NewsHour
- Bloomberg (financial), Financial Times

**Official sources:**
- Government statements, official press releases
- International organizations (UN, WHO, World Bank, USGS)
- Academic peer-reviewed studies (when verifiable)

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple on-staff reporters
- Editorial standards and fact-checking
- Corrections policy published
- Sources cited in articles
- Long-standing reputation

### ⚠️ Tier 2: Moderate credibility (use with caution)

**Mainstream outlets (bias acknowledged):**
- CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, The Guardian, NYT, WaPo (opinion sections clearly marked)

**Specialty outlets:**
- Jerusalem Post, Times of Israel (Israel news)
- Open Doors, Voice of the Martyrs (persecution — advocacy but documented)
- Wall Street Journal (news vs. opinion)

**Characteristics:**
- Known editorial bias (note which direction)
- Mix of news and opinion
- Still follow journalistic standards
- Requires cross-verification with opposite-bias sources

### 🚨 Tier 3: Low credibility (verify extensively or avoid)

**Red flags:**
- No named authors
- No sources cited
- Clickbait headlines
- Extreme partisan language
- Anonymous "insider" claims
- "Breaking" claims no other outlets report

**Known problematic:**
- Satirical sites (Babylon Bee, The Onion) — clearly satire, not news
- Conspiracy-focused sites (InfoWars, etc.)
- Heavily editorialized blogs presented as news
- State propaganda outlets (without disclaimers)

### ❌ Tier 4: Reject immediately

- **Fake news sites** (domain names mimicking real outlets)
- **AI-generated fake articles** (no human byline, nonsensical details)
- **Social media rumors** (unverified tweets, Facebook posts without source)
- **Chain emails / WhatsApp forwards**

## Red flag checklist (before citing a source)

Before accepting a headline as fact, check:

- [ ] **Named author?** (If "staff" or anonymous, lower credibility)
- [ ] **Sources cited?** (Does the article cite who said what?)
- [ ] **Date recent?** (Old news recirculated as "breaking"?)
- [ ] **Other outlets confirm?** (Or is this exclusive/unverified?)
- [ ] **Extreme language?** ("Shocking!" "They don't want you to know!" = clickbait)
- [ ] **Domain legitimate?** (abc.com.co vs. abc.com = fake)
- [ ] **Images/video authentic?** (Reverse image search to check)
- [ ] **Financial bias?** (Sponsored content, ads disguised as news?)

**If 3+ red flags:** Do NOT cite until verified by Tier 1 source.

## Cross-verification protocol

**Minimum standard:** 3 sources, including at least 1 Tier 1 source.

**Ideal standard:**
- 1 Tier 1 source (Reuters, AP, BBC)
- 1 left-leaning source
- 1 right-leaning source
- All three report same factual details (ignore opinion/spin)

**If sources disagree on facts:**
- Mark confidence: **Low**
- Note discrepancies in classification table
- Wait for more verification before ticking any boxes

## Propaganda identification

**Warning signs:**
- Appeals to emotion without evidence
- Demonization of entire groups
- "Us vs. them" framing (without factual basis)
- Unverifiable claims ("sources say," "experts warn" without names)
- Suppression of counter-evidence

**Biblical caution:** "The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going" (Prov 14:15)

**Action:** When propaganda detected, escalate verification requirement to 5+ sources including international outlets.

## Satire and parody detection

**Known satire sites:**
- Babylon Bee (Christian satire)
- The Onion (general satire)
- The Daily Mash (UK satire)
- (Many others)

**How to detect:**
- Check "About" page (satire sites usually disclose)
- Look for absurd details (exaggeration for humor)
- Reverse image search (stock photos used)
- No verification from real news outlets

**If satire cited by mistake:** Immediately correct; do NOT include in news review.

## AI-generated fake news detection

**Warning signs:**
- Generic author names ("John Smith, Reporter")
- Nonsensical details (AI hallucinations)
- Perfect grammar but odd phrasing
- No author bio or social media presence
- Recent site creation date (WHOIS lookup)
- Stock images used throughout

**Verification:**
- Search for author name in other publications (real reporters have history)
- Check domain registration date (new = suspicious)
- Look for social proof (no journalists link to it = red flag)

**If AI-generated suspected:** Reject source; search for real coverage of same event.

## Source bias spectrum (for cross-verification)

| Left-leaning | Center | Right-leaning |
|--------------|--------|---------------|
| CNN, MSNBC | Reuters, AP | Fox News, Breitbart |
| The Guardian | BBC News | The Daily Wire |
| NYT, WaPo | NPR (news) | NY Post, WSJ (opinion) |
| Vox, Slate | Bloomberg | National Review |

**Use this for:** Ensuring cross-spectrum verification (required by news-methodology rule).

## Official vs. media reports

**Hierarchy of sources (when available):**

1. **Primary source** (official statement, government announcement, scientific study)
2. **Tier 1 news reporting on primary source** (Reuters summarizing WHO report)
3. **Tier 2 news analysis** (CNN opinion on WHO report)

**Preference:** Always cite primary source if accessible.

**Example:**
- ❌ Weak: "CNN reports that WHO declared a pandemic"
- ✅ Strong: "WHO declared a pandemic (official statement, WHO.int); confirmed by Reuters, BBC, AP"

## Persecution-specific sources

**High credibility (but advocacy-based):**
- Open Doors World Watch List (documented cases)
- Voice of the Martyrs (verified reports)
- International Christian Concern (investigative)

**Verification requirement:** Cross-check with secular news (Reuters, BBC) AND regional outlets when possible.

**Why:** Advocacy groups have incentive to highlight suffering; secular outlets have incentive to underreport. Truth usually verified by both.

## Economic data sources

**Tier 1 (authoritative):**
- World Bank Open Data
- IMF reports
- National statistics agencies (BLS, ONS, Eurostat, etc.)
- Central bank reports (Federal Reserve, ECB, etc.)

**Tier 2 (analysis):**
- Bloomberg, Financial Times, Reuters (financial)
- Trading Economics (aggregates official data)

**Caution:** Economic forecasts ≠ economic data. Prefer historical data over predictions.

## When in doubt

**Protocol:**
1. Search for Tier 1 source coverage
2. If found → cite Tier 1 source primarily
3. If not found → mark confidence: Low; wait for verification
4. If only Tier 3/4 sources → do NOT include in review

**Biblical wisdom:** "A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident" (Prov 14:16)

## AI instruction

You (the AI) must:
- ✅ Assess source credibility before citing
- ✅ Note credibility tier in classification table
- ✅ Warn user if only Tier 2/3 sources available
- ✅ Refuse to cite Tier 4 (fake news, satire as fact)
- ✅ Prioritize Tier 1 sources in searches

**When user provides a questionable source:**
> "I checked [source name]. This appears to be [Tier 2/3/satirical/AI-generated]. Let me search for Tier 1 verification from Reuters, AP, or BBC."
