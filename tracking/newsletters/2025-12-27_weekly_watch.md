## 📖 This Week's Scripture Focus

> **Matthew 24:7-8** — 'For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. **All these are the beginning of sorrows.**'

### Reflection:

In reflecting on Matthew 24:7-8, we observe that the current intensities of earthquakes at 64/100 and famines at 30/100 may resonate with the 'beginning of sorrows' described in scripture. While we witness a notable number of earthquakes and a stable economic landscape, it is essential to remember that conflicts remain absent and wars are at a low intensity of 0/100. Yet, we must hold fast to the truth that "the end is not yet


This week's data breakdown:

- ⏸️ **Wars** — Intensity 0/100
- ✅ **Earthquakes** — Intensity 64/100
- ⏸️ **Famines** — Intensity 30/100

**Key phrase:** 'All these are the **beginning** of sorrows' — Jesus explicitly said this is the **start**, not the end. The text requires several major events BEFORE the end:

1. Abomination of desolation (Matt 24:15) — ❌ Not observed
2. Great tribulation (Matt 24:21) — ❌ Not observed
3. Cosmic signs (Matt 24:29) — ❌ Not observed
4. Son of Man appears (Matt 24:30) — ❌ Not observed

**Honest assessment:** We're in the early warning phase, not the final countdown.
