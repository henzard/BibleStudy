## End-times prophecy todo checklist (Bible-only anchors)

**How to use**
- **Status**: mark each item as `Not observed / Observed (headline category) / Escalating / Concluded` in your daily logs.
- **Interpretation guardrail**: this list helps you map news to **biblical categories**; it does **not** assert "this is that."
- **Node IDs**: match your flowchart IDs so you can cross-reference quickly.
