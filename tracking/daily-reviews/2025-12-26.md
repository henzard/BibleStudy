## 3) Daily "what changed?" checklist (trend, not hype)

- **J0 trend**: ☐ lower ☐ stable ☑ rising  
  *Wars/rumors: Gaza tensions, Ukraine ongoing; natural disasters: multiple earthquakes/floods Asia*

- **J1 trend**: ☐ lower ☐ stable ☑ rising  
  *Persecution pressure: Nigeria Christian attacks; US designation as Country of Particular Concern*

- **J2 trend**: ☐ lower ☑ stable ☐ rising  
  *Gospel preached continues (no specific headlines today)*

- **Deception pressure** (J5/AC/MS): ☐ lower ☑ stable ☐ rising  
  *No major deception headlines today*

- **Persecution pressure** (J1/A2): ☐ lower ☐ stable ☑ rising  
  *Nigeria Christian persecution reports; 150M+ affected by disasters/conflict globally*

**Notes (2–5 sentences, restrained):**

This week's headlines show continued wars/rumors (Gaza, Ukraine) and significant natural disasters across Asia (earthquakes, typhoons, floods) consistent with Matthew 24:6-8 categories. Persecution of believers in Nigeria reached threshold for US intervention. Economic uncertainty and digital ID expansion continue as patterns, mapped cautiously to Revelation categories without claiming fulfillment. All trends remain within "beginning of sorrows" category; no end-time climax markers observed.

## 4) Scripture-only recalibration (renewing the mind)

Pick 1–3 passages to read slowly today (write the references, then one sentence of what the text plainly says).

- **Reference:** Matthew 24:4-14  
  **Plain statement:** Jesus warned not to be deceived; wars/famines/earthquakes are beginning of sorrows, not the end yet. Believers will be hated/killed for His name. Gospel must be preached in all the world, then the end comes.

- **Reference:** John 16:33  
  **Plain statement:** Jesus said: in the world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

- **Reference:** Revelation 13:16-17  
  **Plain statement:** The beast (from earth/false prophet) causes all to receive a mark in right hand or forehead; no one can buy or sell without the mark, name of the beast, or number of his name.

## 5) Prayer / obedience application (no headlines)

Write 1–3 concrete obedience steps consistent with A1/A2 (repentance, faith, endurance, love not growing cold):

- Continue sharing the gospel with unbelievers (Matt 24:14; Acts 17:30)
- Pray for persecuted believers in Nigeria and other regions (Heb 13:3)
- Watch and pray; do not be caught unaware (Matt 24:42; Luke 21:36)
- Endure to the end; guard against love growing cold (Matt 24:12-13)
