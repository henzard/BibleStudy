**Scripture read (plain statements):**
- **Reference:** Matthew 24:6-8  
  **Plain statement:** Jesus said we will hear of wars/rumors of wars; not to be troubled; these must happen but the end is not yet. Nations rise against nations; famines, pestilences, earthquakes in various places are the beginning of sorrows.

- **Reference:** Matthew 24:9-12  
  **Plain statement:** Believers will be delivered to tribulation, killed, hated for His name's sake. Many will be offended, betray one another, hate one another. False prophets will arise and deceive many. Iniquity increases; love of many grows cold.

**Obedience / endurance application:**
- Continue sharing the gospel (Matt 24:14; Acts 17:30)
- Watch and pray (Matt 24:42; Luke 21:36)
- Endure to the end; love does not grow cold (Matt 24:13)
