# BibleStudy: Discover Jesus While Learning AI

> **"But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."** — 2 Peter 3:18

## 🎯 Dual Mission

This project has two equally important goals:

1. **📖 Spiritual Growth:** Track end-times prophecy systematically using **Bible-only** interpretation (66 books, no speculation, no date-setting)
2. **🤖 AI Education:** Learn to build "agentic AI systems" through a real-world project that honors God

**My prayer:** That you might **discover Jesus** while learning AI alongside me.

## 🌟 What Makes This Different

**Not just a prophecy tracker.** Not just an AI tutorial.

This is a **living example** of:
- ✝️ How to use AI for Bible study **without compromising Scripture**
- 🛡️ How to build **guardrails** that prevent AI hallucination
- 🚀 How to create **automated systems** that augment (not replace) human discernment
- 📚 How to **document your learning** so others can follow

**Personal + Educational + Evangelistic** = This repo.

## What this project does

This workspace contains:
- **Bible-only (66 books) end-times prophecy tracking** derived from a comprehensive flowchart
- **Daily/weekly news review system** that maps headlines to prophetic categories without claiming fulfillment
- **11 Cursor project rules** that enforce Bible-only interpretation, multi-source verification, and AI honesty
- **11 automation scripts** (Python) that fetch data from 8 Tier-1 sources (USGS, GDACS, FRED, World Bank, UN, NOAA, EFF)
- **SQLite database** for historical tracking and trend analysis
- **TensorFlow integration** for ML-based pattern recognition and trend forecasting
- **Fig Tree Pattern Analysis** (Matt 24:33) - Multi-node intensity scoring across all prophecy categories
- **Automated weekly newsletters** with pattern strength, seasonal metaphor, and Scripture focus

We use:
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools** to search real-time news (Brave Search, Web Search)
- **Cursor project rules** (`.cursor/rules/`) to enforce Bible-only interpretation and AI guardrails
- **AI as thought partner** to challenge assumptions, ask clarifying questions, and suggest alternatives

## How close is "the end"? (Bible-only assessment)

Based on current tracking (as of Dec 26, 2025):

### ✅ What we're observing (Matthew 24 markers)
- **J0 — Beginning of sorrows**: Wars/rumors (Gaza, Ukraine), earthquakes (Myanmar, Asia), famines/disasters (150M+ affected) ✅
- **J1 — Persecution/hatred**: Christian persecution (Nigeria) ✅
- **J2 — Gospel preached**: Ongoing globally ✅

### ❌ What we have NOT observed yet (still future)
- **J3 — Abomination of desolation** (Dan 9:27; Matt 24:15) ❌
- **J4 — Great tribulation** (Matt 24:16-22) ❌
- **J6 — Cosmic signs** (sun darkened, etc.) ❌
- **J7 — Son of Man appears** (Matt 24:30-31) ❌

### 📍 Current phase
**"Beginning of sorrows"** (Matt 24:8) — Jesus explicitly said: *"all these are the beginning of sorrows"* and *"the end is not yet"* (Matt 24:6).

According to the text, the end comes AFTER:
1. Gospel preached in all the world (Matt 24:14) — ongoing ✅
2. Abomination of desolation (Matt 24:15) — not observed ❌
3. Great tribulation (Matt 24:21-22) — not observed ❌
4. Cosmic signs (Matt 24:29) — not observed ❌
5. THEN the Son of Man appears (Matt 24:30) — not observed ❌

**Honest assessment**: We're in the early warning phase. Major markers (J3–J7) remain future.

## 🚀 Quick start

### **Single Command Weekly Update (RECOMMENDED)**

```bash
python scripts/weekly_update.py --days 7
```

**This automatically:**
1. ✅ Runs 8 data collection scripts (USGS, GDACS, World Bank, UN, FRED, NOAA, EFF)
2. ✅ Compiles raw data into `tracking/weekly-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD_weekly_review.md`
3. ✅ Runs Fig Tree Pattern Analysis (Matt 24:33) — multi-node intensity scoring
4. ✅ Generates newsletter in `tracking/newsletters/YYYY-MM-DD_weekly_watch.md`
5. ⏱️ Takes ~60-90 seconds total

**Output includes:**
- **Pattern Strength:** 0-100 score across all nodes (J0 wars, J0 quakes, J0 famines, J6 cosmic, H0 economic, B2 digital)
- **Seasonal Metaphor:** Winter/Early Spring/Mid Spring/Late Spring (fig tree parable)
- **Public Newsletter:** Ready to share with compelling headline, Scripture focus, and ethical disclaimers

**Then:**
1. Review the newsletter: `tracking/newsletters/[date]_weekly_watch.md`
2. (Optional) Cross-verify High confidence items with Reuters/BBC/AP News
3. Share newsletter or use for personal Bible study
4. (Optional) Store historical data: `python scripts/ingest_data.py --days 7`

### **Manual workflow (if needed)**

1. **Read current status**: `tracking/END_TIMES_TODO.md`
2. **See latest newsletter**: `tracking/newsletters/[latest-date]_weekly_watch.md`
3. **One-page workflow guide**: `reference/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` 📋 ← **Print this!**
4. **All rules explained**: `.cursor/rules/README.md`
5. **News methodology**: `.cursor/rules/news-methodology/RULE.md`

## 🔧 How to use this project

1. **Weekly news gathering** (recommended: every Friday or Monday)
   - Run searches using MCP tools: `brave_news_search`, `brave_web_search`, `web_search`
   - Search across 7 categories: wars, disasters, persecution, economy, digital ID, cosmic events, temple news
   - Verify with 3+ sources (left + right + center spectrum)

2. **Daily review creation**
   - Copy template: `templates/DAILY_NEWS_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Fill classification table with verified headlines
   - Map to node IDs from `tracking/END_TIMES_TODO.md`
   - Save as `tracking/daily-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

3. **Update master checklist**
   - Open `tracking/END_TIMES_TODO.md`
   - Mark nodes as "Observed" only if Med/High confidence
   - Add date + brief note to each marked item

4. **Append to running log**
   - Copy one section from daily review
   - Paste into `tracking/DAILY_NEWS_LOG.md` (append-only)

**AI assistance:** The AI will help search news, classify headlines, and enforce Bible-only guardrails automatically.

## Guardrails (Bible-only honesty)

### 🛡️ Core rules (enforced by AI)

1. **No "this is that" claims** — we map headlines to *categories*, not fulfillment
2. **66 books only** — no tradition, no extra-biblical symbolism
3. **Scripture compares with Scripture** (Isa 28:10) — line upon line
4. **Multi-source verification** — minimum 3 sources, cross-spectrum (left + right + center)
5. **"I don't know" is acceptable** — uncertainty is honest and biblical (Deut 29:29)
6. **Confidence levels required** — Low/Med/High for every headline
7. **No hallucination** — AI must search real data; cannot make up sources or verses

### 📰 News verification standards

**To mark a prophecy node as "Observed":**
- ✅ Minimum **3 independent sources**
- ✅ **Cross-spectrum verification** (at least one left-leaning AND one right-leaning source)
- ✅ **Factual consistency** across sources
- ✅ **Confidence: Med or High**

**News tools used:**
- `web_search`, `brave_web_search`, `brave_news_search`, `brave_local_search`, `brave_summarizer`

### 🤖 AI honesty policy

The AI assistant will:
- ✅ Always search for current data before claiming news exists
- ✅ Say "I don't know" when Scripture is silent or sources are insufficient
- ✅ Distinguish "what the text says" from "what it might mean"
- ✅ Correct errors immediately when discovered
- ✅ Never use forbidden phrases like "scholars agree" or "it's well-known"

See `.cursor/rules/ai-honesty/RULE.md` for full policy.
