## 🎯 What the AI will now enforce automatically

Every time you chat with the AI in this project:

### ✅ Bible-Only Interpretation
- Only 66 books cited
- No tradition or "scholars say"
- Scripture compared with Scripture
- "I don't know" when the text is silent

- Minimum 3 sources before marking anything "Observed"
- Cross-spectrum (left + right + center) for every headline
- Confidence levels (Low/Med/High) required
- Sources listed in notes column

### ✅ No Hallucination
- AI must search using MCP tools before claiming news exists
- Cannot make up verses, sources, or data
- Must acknowledge uncertainty
- Immediate error correction if mistakes occur

### ✅ Clean Organization
- New files proposed in correct subdirectories
- Root folder kept clean (README only)
- File naming conventions followed

### ✅ Weekly Workflow
- Systematic search across 7 categories
- Quality checklist before saving
- Trend analysis (week-over-week)
- Only Med/High confidence items tick boxes

## 🚀 Next steps

### Your first weekly review:

1. **Pick a day**: Friday or Monday (your choice)
2. **Ask the AI**: "Search news for this week across all 7 categories"
3. **AI will**:
   - Use `brave_news_search`, `brave_web_search`, `web_search`
   - Search: wars, disasters, persecution, economy, digital ID, cosmic events, temple
   - Verify with 3+ sources (left + right + center)
   - Map to node IDs
   - Create `tracking/daily-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Update `tracking/END_TIMES_TODO.md` (only Med/High confidence)
   - Append to `tracking/DAILY_NEWS_LOG.md`

4. **You review**: Check sources, adjust confidence, approve updates
